## The future of yt-2005-watch
Really? It's been 2 years since this project has started. Unfortunately, it's also time for the project to come to a rest, as it existed in an abandoned state since 2023. I just don't have the time and energy to commit to a project like this anymore, sorry :(

Maybe time will come when I inevitably start to create projects for the Old YouTube Community again? Dunno. Until then, I wish the best for y'all, and goodbye.
